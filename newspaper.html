            <p> Virat Kohli won his first-ever IPL trophy with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the 2025 season. RCB defeated Punjab Kings in the final held in Ahmedabad by six runs. 
                This victory marked RCB's maiden IPL title after 18 years of competing in the league and also represented the first time Kohli, who has been with the franchise since the inaugural season in 2008, won the coveted trophy. Kohli played a significant role in the final match, top-scoring for RCB with 43 runs. He also ended the 2025 season as RCB's leading run-scorer with 657 runs in 15 matches.

            <p>No, Virat Kohli is not currently ranked number one in all three formats of international cricket (Tests, ODIs, and T20Is). While he has achieved the feat of being ranked number one in all three formats simultaneously in the past, specifically in 2018, his current rankings vary across formats. He is currently ranked fourth in ODIs. He is still considered one of the best batsmen in the world across all formats, but not currently the top-ranked player in each.
